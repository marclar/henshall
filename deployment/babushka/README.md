### Deploying with [Babushka](http://babushka.me)

On the hubot server itself, install the latest (stable) Babushka with:

    sh -c "`curl https://babushka.me/up`"
    # OR auto-install with no questions asked via
    sh -c "`curl https://babushka.me/up`" </dev/null

Copy the hubot deps to `~/.babushka/deps` on the remote hubot server:

    scp -r ./deployment/babushka/deps hubot-hostname:~/.babushka/deps

To configure the bot, edit the hubot_options hash in `~/.babushka/deps/hubot.rb`

SSH to the hubot server and install the hubot dep with:

    babushka hubot

This installs all the dependencies required for hubot to run, and starts the
hubot service. Babushka logs to `~/.babushka/logs/hubot`
